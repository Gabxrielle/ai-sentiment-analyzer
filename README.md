# AI Sentiment Analyzer 🧠💬

This is a simple sentiment analysis project built with Python and natural language processing (NLP). It classifies text inputs as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

## 💡 What it does

- Cleans and vectorizes text data
- Trains a logistic regression classifier
- Evaluates model accuracy
- Predicts the sentiment of new sentences

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Files

- `sentiment_model.ipynb` – Main notebook with all code
- `dataset.csv` – Training data with labeled sentences

## 📈 Example

Input: `"I love working on Python projects!"`  
Output: `Positive ✅`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook
2. Open `sentiment_model.ipynb` in Jupyter or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
3. Run all cells and try your own sentence at the end!

## ✨ Next Steps

- Add deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)
- Improve data and preprocessing
- Build a web interface for live predictions
